    My friend once visited this place that served ice cream with coke. He said he had the best Greek omlette of his life and called it a very american experience. Can you find the name of the diner and the amount he paid?

This one took a while due to being a very guessy challenge.

By searching up "old diner coke" we find this

A little digging finds that this is Lexington Candy shop
