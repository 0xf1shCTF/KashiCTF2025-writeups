Unlike the previous two game challenges this is created in Unity meaning that it cannot be fully decompiled.

We can give ourselves infinite money by multiplying the withdraw amount by 5000. This lets us talk to the mysterious man and get a hint.

To do this I used assetRipper and in the audio files of the game there was a flag audio file which when put in audacity showed a flag.
