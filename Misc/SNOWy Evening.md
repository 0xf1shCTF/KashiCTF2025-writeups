We are provided with a poem, visually is has nothing noticeable but the SNOW in the title reminds me of a specific steg tool called StegSnow. I used it on the poem with "Aakash" as the password since he likes using his name as the password

```bash
‚ùØ stegsnow -C -p "Aakash" poemm.txt

But now we are presented with a pastebin link `https://pastebin.com/HVQfa14Z`

Lets visit it!
